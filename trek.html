  		<h2>HAUTE ROUTE</h2>

  		<h2>TORRESS DEL CIRCUIT</h2>
  		<p>Trekking in Torres del Paine is different than anywhere else in the world. You can pretty much count on very strong winds, rain, mud, and sometimes even snow. It sounds extreme but with the proper gear and preparation it’s a lot easier to enjoy it.</p>

  		<h2>GRAND RANDONEE20(GR20)</h2>
  		<p>GR20 is not only counted amongst the world’s top scenic treks, but also the most exigent for both professionals and beginners. This celebrated trail is popular for its diverse landscapes, as it navigates the lofty mountains, ridges, and granite slopes. </p>

  		   <summary>WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT?</summary>
  			<p>Experience the Shepherds lifestyle en route, as you meander through tricky passages and enjoy the pristine views of snow-clad peaks, glacial lakes, and vivid forests. You would simply love the challenge to traverse the rocky and steep pathways in France.</p>
  		</details>
  		<details onclick='closeAll(this.parentNode);'>
  			<summary>BEST TIME TO TREK</summary>
  			<p>The best time for the GR20 trek is late June and early September, when most huts are open, weather is not so hot and the trail is less crowded than in July or August. Between November and May there is snow in the mountains and the trail is quite dangerous.</p>

  		<h2>EVEREST</h2>
  		<p>Everest is shaped like a three-sided pyramid. The three generally flat planes constituting the sides are called faces, and the line by which two faces join is known as a ridge. The southern route via the Khumbu Icefall and the South Col is the one most commonly taken by climbers attempting to summit Everest.</p>

		</div><br>    
		<details onclick='closeAll(this.parentNode);'>
  		<summary>WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT?</summary>
  			<p>This trek originates from the Khumbu region in Nepal Himalayans, where the three majestic mountains namely, Mount Everest, Lhotse Sar, and Mount Lhotse spellbind you. En route, get close and personal with oldest Buddhist Monasteries and Sherpa villages.</p>
  		</details>
  		<details onclick='closeAll(this.parentNode);'>
  			<summary>BEST TIME TO TREK</summary>
  			<p>The best one is in April and May, right before the monsoon. Once the monsoon comes, the snow is too soft and the likelihood of avalanche too great. For a few weeks in September, after the monsoon, weather conditions may also permit an attempt; by October, however, the winter storms begin and persist until March, making climbing then nearly impossible.</p>
