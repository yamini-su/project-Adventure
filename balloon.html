  		<h2>ALBUQUERQUE</h2>
  		<p>Mass ascensions, when many hundreds of balloons lift off into the morning sky, are held on all four weekend mornings and one day mid-week. Mass ascensions begin after "dawn patrol" carefully examines the morning's weather conditions. When the dawn patrol gives the green light, balloons from all over the world rise together in a harmonious lift-off. The sight of 500 balloons in the sky is as breathtaking for first-time visitors.</p>

  		<h2>LUXOR</h2>
  		<p>Seeing Egypt's Valley of the Kings from the basket of a hot air balloon, as the sun rises and turns the desert and lush green of the Nile River landscape golden, is a sight you won't ever forget.

  		</details>
  		<details onclick='closeAll(this.parentNode);'>
  			<summary>BEST TIME TO EXPERIENCE</summary>
  			<p>Weather conditions for ballooning are best just after sunrise and 2-3 hours before sunset. Light, ideal winds (4-6 mph) often occur during these times. During the day, when the sun is high, thermals (large bubbles of hot air that rise from the sun-heated earth) make ballooning hazardous.</p>
